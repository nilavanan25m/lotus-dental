# Lotus Dental Project

This is a TypeScript-based project for the Lotus Dental application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the project to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nilavanan25m/lotus-dental.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**  
   Move into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd lotus-dental
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required npm packages, including TypeScript and other dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server**  
   Start the development server to run the project:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the Application**  
   Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your project configuration).

## Additional Notes
- Ensure TypeScript is installed globally if you want to use the `tsc` command directly:
  ```bash
  npm install -g typescript
  ```
- Check the `package.json` file for other available scripts.
- If you encounter issues, verify that your Node.js and npm versions are compatible.

## Repository
The source code is hosted at:  
[https://github.com/nilavanan25m/lotus-dental.git](https://github.com/nilavanan25m/lotus-dental.git)


### Steps to Create and Push the README

1. **Create the README file**:
   In your project directory (`F:\lotus dental project\project\project`), create a file named `README.md` and copy the above content into it.

   You can do this manually or via command line:
   ```bash
   echo. > README.md
   ```
   Then open `README.md` in a text editor and paste the content.

2. **Stage and Commit the README**:
   Add the file to Git and commit it:
   ```bash
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Add README with TypeScript installation steps"
   ```

3. **Push to GitHub**:
   Since you previously had an issue pushing to `main`, ensure the branch exists and push:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   If `main` still doesnâ€™t exist, create it:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Notes
- I assumed the project uses TypeScript and a typical `npm run dev` setup (common for Node.js/TypeScript projects like those with Vite, Next.js, or similar). If your project uses a different setup (e.g., Yarn, pnpm, or a specific framework), let me know, and I can adjust the instructions.
- If you encounter the same `src refspec main does not match any` error again, double-check with `git branch` and `git log` to ensure there are commits and the branch is correct.
- The README includes a generic port reference (`http://localhost:3000`). If your project uses a different port or URL, let me know to update it.

Let me know if you need help with anything else, like verifying the push or tweaking the README!
