# Lotus Dental Project

This is a TypeScript-based project for the Lotus Dental application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the project to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nilavanan25m/lotus-dental.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**  
   Move into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd lotus-dental
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required npm packages, including TypeScript and other dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server**  
   Start the development server to run the project:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the Application**  
   Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your project configuration).

## Additional Notes
- Ensure TypeScript is installed globally if you want to use the `tsc` command directly:
  ```bash
  npm install -g typescript
  ```
- Check the `package.json` file for other available scripts.
- If you encounter issues, verify that your Node.js and npm versions are compatible.
